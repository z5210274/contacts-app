# All functionalities
- The Resonate button on the top left of the screen, will redirect you to the home application.
- In the search bar, you can search for a contact's Name, Username, City and Company. (Partial input can still return the right user but you can only search for one category at a time)
- The dropdown menu on the top right of the screen allows you to sort all the contacts alphabetically based on their Name, Location and Company.
- All the contacts will be displayed on the main section, you can click the magnifying glass icon on the bottom right of each contact card to expand for more details for the contact.

Thank you for taking the time to review my application for Resonate Solutions and to review my code for both the contacts and app encoder and I hope you have a great day!
